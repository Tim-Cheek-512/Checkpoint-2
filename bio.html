        <h3> About Me, </h3>
          <p> I am currently a craft bartender in Austin, Texas. I had been going to school for finance when I discovered coding. After trying a little online, I was into it! I started saving money to take some courses to learn to code, and improve my design ability. I understand this was a big turn to make after three years of college, but I have always been a person who chases what they are passionate about one-hudred percent. Technology is that passion for me, It has proven deeply fascinating and keeps me constantly chasing the next,
            <br> "ah-ha!" moment.</p>
